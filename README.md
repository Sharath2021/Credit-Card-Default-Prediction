# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
Credit risk plays an important role in the banking industry business. Credit card has been one of the most booming businesses in banking sectors but with its pros comes some cons also. With the growing numbers of credit card users the default rate is also increasing which is jeopardizing the banking sector. So to tackle this growing problem the world needs solutions and one of it is to try and predict in time which customer can result in a default. In this report we are applying various Machine Learning algorithms to predict and analyse the default rate and hence to see which all features are important to make a robust and efficient model.



This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments
